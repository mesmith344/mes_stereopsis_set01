# mes_stereopsis_set01
Ten thousand (10000) Blender-generated paired image files of random polyhedra at random distances from two different vantage points (left and right), simulating stereopsis (aka binocular vision). The image pairs are meant to be used to train a computer model to estimate distances via stereopsis, an ability which is a component of depth perception. As such, the distance for each image pair is also provided as a dimensionless ratio of two distances, the distance to the object over the distance between the two vantage points.
